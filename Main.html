            <h4>Entitlement of Leave</h4>
            <p>All the employees are entitled for 24 leaves in the accounting year and hence 2 leaves will be credited to their account on first day of the month. Accounting year for the purpose of leave will be from January to December. In case if an employee
              joins in the mid of the year then he will be entitled for leave on the prorata basis for the remaining period of the accounting year.
              <br>
              <br> Normally an employee can avail maximum leaves up to available leave balance credit up to that month. In case of continues leaves, intervening weekly offs/ holidays will be treated as leaves. All leaves has to be intimated, applied and
              sanctioned in advance before going on leave.
            </p>

            <h4>Leave without Pay</h4>
            <p>If an employee is taking more leaves than accumulated leave balance to his credit due to pressing requirement to go on leave to meet some unavoidable commitments; can be granted leave without pay (LWP) at the sole discretion of management.
              This is however granted only in exceptional cases. The implications of leave without pay are as follows.
              <br>
              <br>No salary and no monetary benefits whatsoever during the period of leave.
              <br>
              <br> An employee taking leave without prior sanction of leave will be treated on LWP. However in these cases reasons for absence and the circumstances under which the employee could not get his/her leave pre-sanctioned are first investigated
              and then the leave is regularized as paid leave at the sole discretion of management.
            </p>

            <h4>Compensatory Leave</h4>
            <p>All employees who are asked to work on weekly-off days or overstay on working days are entitled for compensatory leave. Compensatory leave will be credited as ¼ day for every completed two hours of work. No compensatory leave will be credited
              for instances of less than 2 hours. Such Compensatory leave will be merged with the leave entitlement. All the compensatory leave shall be entered in the Leave Card immediately on the next day of extra work and submitted for approval.</p>

            <h4>Short Leave</h4>
            <p>All the employees are expected to report to the duty on or before their stipulated reporting time in general but not later than 10 minutes after stipulated reporting time in exceptional circumstances.
              <br>
              <br>Management recognizes that due to issues related to vehicle or traffic rush an employee might get delayed beyond 10 minutes. Management will grant such delays in reporting to the duty beyond 10 minutes but not later than 30 minutes from
              stipulated reporting time as SHORT LEAVE. Such instances of grant of Short leaves are two instances per calendar month; third instance and onwards will treated as each of 1/4 leave.
              <br>
              <br>Management also recognizes need for leave to attend any personal work during working hours. Management will grant one instance per month of 1 hour leave per calendar month during working hours.
              <br>
              <br>Short leaves shall not be clubbed with each other or merged with any other leave.
              <br>
              <br>Short leaves shall not be treated as right to claim and hence Short Leaves will not be carried forward. All instances of Short leaves shall be recorded in the leave card and sanctioned by sanctioning authority.
            </p>

            <h4>Leave Accumulation &amp; Encashment</h4>
            <p>Accounting of leave is done based on calendar year from January to December. Leave can be accumulated and Leave Balance including Compensatory leave will be carry forwarded to next leave accounting year. At the end of Leave accounting year,
              employee whose accumulated leave balances exceeds 15 days can opt of encashment of leaves exceeding 15 days.
              <br>
              <br>The encashment is done at the rate of salary paid for the month of December of that year. Payment for encashed leave however shall be done by 31st January of the following year. If an employee do not opt for encashment, all accumulated
              balances will be carry forwarded to next Leave accounting year.
              <br>
              <br>Leave encashment request will not be entertained during mid of the year. Leave encashment request shall be forwarded as per attached format. </p>

            <h4>Sanctioning Authority</h4>
            <p>Leave Cards for each employee will be maintained separately and will be kept with administration department at all the times. Employees can collect their leave card from administration department for leave application and return back to administration
              after taking sanction of leave from Management. Leave will be sanctioned as per the balance and in line with the exigencies of the work.</p>
            <p>All employees are requested to co-operate and follow the company leave rules.</p>

        <h2>AutoCAD Guidelines</h2>
      </header>
      <p>While preparing CAD drawings, please keep following things in mind.</p>
      <ol class="noBullets">
        <li>One should never use lines, only p-lines to be used.</li>
        <li>Every hatch must be associative and with its Boundary.</li>
        <li>No separate leaders to be provided, Use Standard Leaders from MSA Standard.</li>
        <li>In model space, only relevant and final information shall be kept. All the unnecessary information must be deleted.</li>
        <li>Create blocks as and when necessary. Name of blocks must be relevant. Also make sure the blocks are not in a layer that is unplottable. Such as Gen_Viewport Boundary. The blocks shall be placed in relevant layer and not in layer 0.
        </li>
        <li>Use of array is forbidden.</li>
        <li>No layer other than MSA Standard Layers should exist in the drawing. If due to some reason you are not able achieve this, please speak with the team leader.</li>
        <li>Frozen or Turned Off layers should be deleted before releasing the drawing.</li>
        <li>Size of Text, Dimensions, and Annotations must be as per the scale of Viewport in Layout and MSA Standards.</li>
        <li>Model Space must contain only the drawing objects. Legends, Key Plan, Tables etc must be in the layout (paper) Space only.</li>
        <li>Level guides must be kept back in draw order.</li>
        <li>Grid lines must be kept in front in draw order.</li>
        <li>Key Plans should not contain any unnecessary Text/Data. Relevent Objects to be Highlighted.</li>
        <li>The left most bottom corner of your building shall be placed at (0,0,0) cordinated in model space. This shall not be changed afterwards.</li>
        <li>Everything Should be aligned in Model Space and Layout Space, Follow the links provided below for reference:

        <h2>Design Basis Approach</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Contrary to what one is led to believe in college/ institute, architecture is not simply an art. Creativity is always appreciated; however, a lot of money, time, and resources are at stake in a typical project. Therefore, you are supposed to justify
        your ideas. Design basis approach will help you achieve that.
        <br>
        <br> At MSA, at whatever level you are engaged in, you are expected to present your ideas with some design basis. Examples of design basis would be official specification document, official client requirements, local bylaws, national standards,
        Handbooks, reference guides, scientific papers, etc.
        <br>
        <br> Work or ideas without a solid design basis will almost always invite revisions. Therefore, you are requested to understand this concept and adopt it in your daily project delivery.
